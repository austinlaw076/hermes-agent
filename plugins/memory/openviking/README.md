# OpenViking Memory Provider

Context database by Volcengine (ByteDance) with filesystem-style knowledge hierarchy, tiered retrieval, and automatic memory extraction.

## Requirements

- OpenViking installed with the `openviking-server` command available
- OpenViking server config initialized and validated (`openviking-server init`,
  then `openviking-server doctor`)
- OpenViking server running and reachable from Hermes

OpenViking 0.2.10 or newer is recommended. For backward compatibility,
Hermes can identify older servers that expose the legacy status-only health
response, but only when anonymous OpenAPI metadata also identifies the service
as OpenViking. OpenViking 0.2.6 and earlier are deprecated for this integration;
upgrade them to receive the current health contract and compatibility fixes.

## Setup

Prepare OpenViking first:

```bash
openviking-server init
openviking-server doctor
openviking-server
```

Then configure Hermes:

```bash
hermes memory setup    # select "openviking"
```

The setup can link to an existing `~/.openviking/ovcli.conf`, copy its current
connection values into Hermes, or create a minimal `ovcli.conf` when one does
not exist.

Or manually:

```bash
hermes config set memory.provider openviking
```

Add the connection settings to the active profile's `.env` file. For the
default profile that is `~/.hermes/.env`; for a named profile use
`~/.hermes/profiles/<profile>/.env`.

```text
OPENVIKING_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:1933
# OPENVIKING_API_KEY=...
# OPENVIKING_ACCOUNT=default
# OPENVIKING_USER=default
# OPENVIKING_AGENT=hermes
```

## Config

OpenViking's server config is separate from Hermes:

- `ov.conf` configures OpenViking storage, embedding/VLM models, auth, and
  server behavior. OpenViking reads it from `--config`,
  `OPENVIKING_CONFIG_FILE`, or `~/.openviking/ov.conf`.
- `ovcli.conf` stores client/CLI connection values such as `url`, `api_key`,
  `account`, and `user`. It is read from `OPENVIKING_CLI_CONFIG_FILE` or
  `~/.openviking/ovcli.conf`.

Hermes-side provider config is read from environment variables in the active
profile's `.env`:

| Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `OPENVIKING_ENDPOINT` | `http://127.0.0.1:1933` | Server URL |
| `OPENVIKING_API_KEY` | (none) | User/admin API key for authenticated servers |
| `OPENVIKING_ACCOUNT` | `default` | Tenant account for local/trusted mode |
| `OPENVIKING_USER` | `default` | Tenant user for local/trusted mode |
| `OPENVIKING_AGENT` | `hermes` | Hermes peer ID in OpenViking, used for peer-scoped memories |

When `OPENVIKING_API_KEY` is set, Hermes lets OpenViking derive account/user
identity from the key. In local or trusted deployments without an API key,
Hermes sends `OPENVIKING_ACCOUNT` and `OPENVIKING_USER` as identity headers.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `viking_search` | Semantic search with fast/deep/auto modes |
| `viking_read` | Read content at a viking:// URI (abstract/overview/full) |
| `viking_browse` | Filesystem-style navigation (list/tree/stat) |
| `viking_remember` | Store a fact directly with OpenViking `content/write` |
| `viking_forget` | Delete one exact `viking://` memory file URI |
| `viking_add_resource` | Ingest URLs/docs into the knowledge base |

## Memory Writes And Deletes

`viking_remember` writes directly to OpenViking with `POST /api/v1/content/write`
and `mode=create`. It creates peer-scoped memory files under
`viking://user/peers/${OPENVIKING_AGENT}/memories/...`; OpenViking may return a
canonical user-scoped form such as
`viking://user/default/peers/${OPENVIKING_AGENT}/memories/...` in API-key mode.
Explicit remembers do not depend on session commit extraction.

Successful Hermes built-in `memory` mutations are mirrored through a durable,
profile-scoped outbox. Two private local files under `$HERMES_HOME/openviking/`
track the bridge:

```text
memory_mirror_registry.json   # latest intended stable URI/state
memory_mirror_outbox.jsonl    # append-only event + acknowledgement journal
```

Each event and acknowledgement is flushed and `fsync()`ed before the append
returns. The registry uses intended-state lifecycle values (`pending_create`,
`active`, `pending_replace`, `pending_delete`) so a later local mutation can
resolve the same stable URI even while an earlier remote operation is still
pending.

| Hermes action | Durable / OpenViking behavior |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| `add` | journal an event first, derive `mem_evt_<event_id>.md`, record `pending_create`, then `content/write` with `mode=create` |
| `replace` | resolve exactly one registry URI before journaling, record full before/after content, then replace that same URI with `wait=true` |
| `remove` | resolve exactly one registry URI before journaling, record the exact URI, then delete it with `wait=true` |

The event URI is final once journaled. Replay never uses semantic similarity or
`old_text` to rediscover a target. If a replayed create encounters its exact URI
already present, Hermes reads that same URI only: identical content is treated
as already applied, while different content is a deterministic conflict that
stops ordered replay rather than guessing.

OpenViking availability no longer gates durable journaling. If the backend is
down, the event remains unacknowledged and the FIFO worker retries it with a
bounded exponential delay. Provider startup scans the outbox automatically,
reconstructs the latest intended registry state from exact unacknowledged
events, and replays them in original journal order even if no new memory write
occurs after restart. An acknowledgement is appended only after the remote
operation is applied/verified and the corresponding registry transition is
written.

The mirror registry/outbox owns only memories created through this built-in
memory bridge. Session-extracted memories and explicit `viking_remember` writes
are not registered or modified by it. Existing OpenViking memories created
before the registry was introduced also have no safe automatic mapping: a later
built-in `replace` or `remove` for such an entry fails closed with a warning and
leaves OpenViking unchanged rather than guessing which memory to mutate. Use
`viking_forget` with an exact URI for manual cleanup of those entries.

### Durability boundaries

Once an outbox event append has returned successfully, that exact mutation
intent survives a process restart and can be retried idempotently. This bridge
is deliberately not a distributed transaction with Hermes' native memory
files, however: Hermes calls the provider hook after the `MEMORY.md` / `USER.md`
mutation succeeds, so a crash in the narrow interval before the outbox event is
fsynced can still leave a native entry without a mirror event. Reconciliation
and legacy backfill are separate follow-up work.

The current FIFO and registry serialization guarantee applies within one Hermes
provider process. Cross-process locking/serialization and journal compaction are
also separate follow-up concerns; this implementation keeps the JSONL journal
append-only for auditability.

`viking_forget` is intentionally narrow. It only accepts concrete user memory
file URIs, such as
`viking://user/peers/hermes/memories/preferences/mem_abc123.md` or the canonical
`viking://user/default/peers/hermes/memories/preferences/mem_abc123.md`. Files
directly under `memories/`, such as `viking://user/default/memories/profile.md`,
are also allowed because OpenViking supports them. The tool rejects directories,
resources, skills, sessions, generated summary files, and URIs with query
strings or fragments. Use OpenViking's MCP, CLI, or admin APIs for broader
resource and directory cleanup.
